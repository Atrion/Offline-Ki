- Added /getsparklies command to collect all the sparklies at once (for the lazy ones...)

- Hide the arrow for choosing marker game type

Offline KI 3.4 (27.9.2010):
- You can now download updates for the fan-age data in a dedicated UAM package - the /updateshelf command has therefore been removed

- Fixed linking from Seret to Gahreesen on Alcugs Shards

Offline KI 3.3 (21.8.2010):
- Added link to Seret in the city and the Nexus (needs MOUL ages converted with Drizzle 27). Thanks a lot to Kaelis Ebonrai!
- Added autolink feature: "/autolink <age filename>" tells the KI to automatically link you to the specified age on next startup. "/autolink disable" disables this feature.
- Added /listsdl command to list all SDL variables available in the current age. Optionally takes a case-insensitive filter as argument (e.g. "/listsdl yeesha" will only list SDL variables with "yeesha" in their name)

- Fixed the visitor logger in the Guild Neighborhood
- Fixed Sparkly fireworks in multiplayer environments

- Fixed Bahro stone linking panels (thanks to Kaelis Ebonrai for catching this)
- Fixed /link command to no longer attempt to link to unavailable ages

Offline KI 3.2 (14.3.2010):
- Be sure to hit the "Start" button next to the POTS folder selection in Drizzle Simplicity after installing the Offline KI. We moved a lot of prp file changes from the Offline KI (where the full file had to be distributed) to Drizzle (which can patch the file in-place). You have to do this only once though, and each time this part of Drizzle (the so-called "inplacemods") is updated.
- Added soccer ball in the city which most likely was created by Cyan during D'mala, extracted by unknown hackers and now put into a separate file by Agenotfound

- German and French players can now also link to Eder Tsogal (requires MOUL files to be re-converted using Drizzle 23)

- Move the Jalak column states into the sav directory
- Properly fixed the problem of linking while playing a marker mission - the game is now seamlessly continues after linking, so games with markers in many ages are no longer that annoying :)
- Fixed some locks in Relto not really "locking" the book for visitors
- Fixed the hood visitor loggers to no longer reset after 15 visits
- Fixed the Gahreesen maintainer suit machine to also deliver the suit if you already have it in your closet
- Fixed wrong linking images being shown in the Relto books

Offline KI 3.1 (20.1.2010):
- Offline KI now contains empty (dummy) sum files for all TPOTS ages to prevent errors due to changed checksums (Drizzle already creates such empty files for the converted ages)
- The new "/help" command opens a book listing all available commands (inspired by an old AdminKI)
- Added "/getfissure" command by D'Lanor, takes the fissure stage (1-4) as argument
- Added "/anim" command to run a specified animation (can even run aniamtions from the "wrong" gender :D ) on yourself or other players. "/anim list" gives you some pre-defined animation sequences (inspired by an old AdminKI)
- Enabled a new Bahro stone in Gahreesen - have fun finding it :) (thanks to Agenotfound for the tip)
- Added Hex Isle linking images (thanks a lot to Perlenstern)

Offline KI 3.0 (10.11.2009):
- The Offline KI now supports being used on Alcugs Shards and brings a lot of multiplayer fixes written by various people (see /info)
- Administrative KI commands can now be enabled and disabled based on who logs in where (so the same KI can be an AdminKI on one Shard and a UserKI on another one, depending on the privileges of the logged in user)
- When Flymode is enabled, the num-pad key "-" can be used to move the avatar up, and "+" moves it down (the first is located above the latter)
- Flymode also works online, but the position other players see is updated only when a key is pressed or released
- Added SDL options for the tickers and the Myst V books in the city (thanks a lot to Agenotfound!). There are also new /set options for these: "/set tickers 0|1" and "/set mystvbooks 0|1".
- "/set guildhall 0|1" now also enables/disables the guild hall accident (thanks to Agenotfound and Dustin)

- Replaced "/getlibrarybooks" by "/set librarybooks 0|1", the option is now permanently saved in SDL vars (so that the books are still there when you come back). In addition, the textures of Ahnonay and Er'cana linking book are fixed in the city and the Er'cana linking book works (thanks to Agenotfound)
- Added KI command /kiusage to show you how many pictures, notes and so on you already used up
- The new command /checkaccess shows your current access level
- Thanks to Dustin, Relto's custom book covers load much faster now and take less memory, as do the custom linking images in Nexus
- The heek table no longer looks broken - thanks to Dustin and Agenotfound (it still can not be used though). Use "/set heek" to control it: 0 = no heek table; 1 = heek table looks correct, but is disabled; 2 = heek table looks correct and is enabled; 3 = heek table looks broken
- Added a patch by Dustin which fixes multiplayer issues in Ahnonay Sphere 1
- "/link" is now case-insensitive
- "/updateshelf silence" is now permanent, you have to type "/updateshelf remind" to enable the reminder again
- "/hideki" now also hides the cursor (until you move it again...)
- Re-organized pak file structure
- Fixed crash when entering the wall area in Gahreesen (this does NOT make the wall itself functional!)
- Fixed multiplayer issue in Phil's Relto (thanks to D'Lanor)
